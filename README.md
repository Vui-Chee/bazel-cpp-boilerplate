# bazel-cpp-boilerplate

### Requirement
Go [here](https://bazel.build/) to install Bazel which will be used to compile cpp code.

### How to use?

Write your function in your-code.cc.

You should not need to `include` any files since most of them are included in lib/stdc++.h.

Change `#! /bin/[your shell]` in run.sh.

Afterwards, to build and run your code, type `[your shell] run.sh run-test`.
